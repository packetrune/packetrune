## 🧩 About Me

I'm a Senior Game Developer specializing in Unity with a strong foundation in C# and C++, delivering high-performance, scalable systems for games and interactive applications across platforms. With years of experience in both gameplay and low-level systems, I work comfortably at the intersection of design, engineering, and performance.

From real-time multiplayer games to XR experiences and in-house tools, I bring a production-first mindset and clean architecture to every project.
